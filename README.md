# Discord Feature Update Project

## Summary
### New features
1. **Live call captioning.** Added accessibility feature that provides real-time closed captioning and call transcription for voice channels.  
2. **Server previewing.** A new feature that lets users visit a server and view channels without having to join first. Server admins can choose which voice and text channels are available to visiting members.  
3. **In-app notification volume adjustment.** This new feature lets users customize the volume level of discord's notification sounds. Notification sounds can also be muted.  
4. **Conversations.** A "huddle" feature for temporary voice chats that expire after 10 minutes of inactivity. These side conversations can be open to all server members or invite-only.  

### Bug fixes
1. **Fixed audio issue:** User is invisibly muted when they launch a game. They cannot unmute themselves and have to leave and rejoin the audio channel.
2. **More frequent member updates:** Participants are still shown as being in an audio channel after a user has been inactive for a period of time.
